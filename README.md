# Ambi

Meet Ambi, your new best ambient friend. He likes to focus on creating music so that you can focus on the processing of the sounds. You see Ambi is a self generating notes and chords creator. He will pick the key, scales, time, pitch ... all so that you can focus on manipulating the sound.

## How does it work?

- You will need to download [sonic-pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)
- Then copy [Ambi](https://github.com/guillec/ambi/blob/main/ambi.rb) into sonic-pi and press play.

After this Ambi will start spitting out some mad notes and chords... s/he is an artist do not judge.
