# Ambi

Meet Ambi, your new best ambient friend. S/He likes to focus on creating music so that you can focus on the processing of sounds. Ambi is a self generating notes and chords creator. S/He will pick the key, scales, time, pitch ... all so that you can focus on manipulating the sound.

## How to use?

- You will need to download and install [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)
- [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillec/ambi/main/ambi.rb "download") the ambi.rb file.

- Press 'run'


After this, Ambi will start spitting out some mad notes and chords... s/he is the artist, do not judge.

## Why would I used this?

I can think of a two good reason why this tool is helpful.

1. You get a looper pedal for free. If you are like me and use your looper pedal at the beginning of your signal chain, Ambi replaces it. So now you can use that looper in other parts of your signal.

2. No need to think about what to play today, just let Ambi handle it for you. This lets you focus on the processing of sound.

## Examples

Here are three short and three longer examples of what you can do with Ambi.

## Questions or Comments

Feel free to write an issue on the project. I can also be reached at via [IG/guillecarlos](https://www.instagram.com/guillecarlos/). I will also be streaming [Ambi on twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/guille_carlos), not sure when or how often but it will happen. 

## What is next?

- Add more random sprinkle notes. 
- Add more ambientish chord progressions.
- Thinking of keeping the chords in lower frequency.
